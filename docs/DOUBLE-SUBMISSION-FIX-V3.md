# Double Submission Fix V3 - Token Consumption Issue

## üö® Problem Identified

**Issue:** Assessment submissions were consuming 2 tokens instead of 1 due to redundant wrapper functions causing double API calls.

**Root Cause:** Multiple submission paths were executing for the same assessment due to redundant wrapper functions:

1. **Path 1:** `utils/assessment-workflow.ts` ‚Üí `submitWithWebSocket` ‚Üí `submitAssessment` (consumes 1 token)
2. **Path 2:** `submitAssessmentWithWebSocket` ‚Üí `submitAssessmentForWebSocket` ‚Üí `submitAssessment` (consumes 1 token again)

## üîç Detailed Analysis

### The Problem Flow:

1. The `submitAssessmentForWebSocket` function in `services/enhanced-assessment-api.ts` was a redundant wrapper that called `submitAssessment` internally
2. The `submitAssessmentWithWebSocket` function called `submitAssessmentForWebSocket` which then called `submitAssessment`
3. In some cases, the workflow would call `submitAssessment` directly, but other components would use the wrapper functions
4. This resulted in multiple API calls for the same assessment, consuming 2 tokens instead of 1

### Code Evidence:

```typescript
// PROBLEM 1: Redundant wrapper function
export async function submitAssessmentForWebSocket(
  assessmentData: AssessmentScores,
  assessmentName: string = 'AI-Driven Talent Mapping',
  onTokenBalanceUpdate?: () => Promise<void>
): Promise<{ jobId: string; queuePosition?: number }> {
  // Submit assessment (same as regular submission) - CONSUMES TOKEN
  const submitResponse = await submitAssessment(assessmentData, assessmentName, onTokenBalanceUpdate);
  return {
    jobId: submitResponse.data.jobId,
    queuePosition: submitResponse.data.queuePosition,
  };
}

// PROBLEM 2: Double wrapper calling the wrapper above
export async function submitAssessmentWithWebSocket(
  assessmentData: AssessmentScores,
  assessmentName: string = 'AI-Driven Talent Mapping',
  onProgress?: (status: AssessmentStatusResponse) => void,
  onTokenBalanceUpdate?: () => Promise<void>
): Promise<AssessmentStatusResponse> {
  // Submit assessment for WebSocket monitoring - CALLS WRAPPER ABOVE
  const submitResponse = await submitAssessmentForWebSocket(assessmentData, assessmentName, onTokenBalanceUpdate);
  // ...
}
```

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Removed Redundant Wrapper Function**
- Deleted `submitAssessmentForWebSocket` function completely
- Added comments to explain the removal

### 2. **Fixed submitAssessmentWithWebSocket Function**
- Modified to call `submitAssessment` directly
- Added logging to track direct submission
- Ensured proper jobId extraction

### 3. **Updated ApiService**
- Updated `submitAssessmentWithWebSocket` method to use the fixed implementation
- Added logging to track direct submission

### 4. **Fixed ai-analysis.ts Imports**
- Removed import of the deleted `submitAssessmentForWebSocket` function

## üõ†Ô∏è Changes Made

### File: `services/enhanced-assessment-api.ts`
```typescript
// BEFORE (BUGGY):
export async function submitAssessmentWithWebSocket(...) {
  // Submit assessment for WebSocket monitoring
  const submitResponse = await submitAssessmentForWebSocket(assessmentData, assessmentName, onTokenBalanceUpdate);
  // ...
}

// AFTER (FIXED):
export async function submitAssessmentWithWebSocket(...) {
  console.log('Enhanced Assessment API: Submitting assessment with WebSocket monitoring - FIXED: Direct submission to prevent double token consumption');

  // Submit assessment directly (FIXED: removed wrapper to prevent double token consumption)
  const submitResponse = await submitAssessment(assessmentData, assessmentName, onTokenBalanceUpdate);
  const jobId = submitResponse.data.jobId;
  // ...
}
```

### File: `services/ai-analysis.ts`
```typescript
// BEFORE:
import { submitAssessmentForWebSocket } from './enhanced-assessment-api';

// AFTER:
// REMOVED: import { submitAssessmentForWebSocket } - function deleted to fix double token consumption
```

### File: `services/apiService.js`
```javascript
// BEFORE:
async submitAssessmentWithWebSocket(assessmentData, assessmentName = 'AI-Driven Talent Mapping', onProgress) {
  const { submitAssessmentWithWebSocket } = await import('./enhanced-assessment-api');
  return await submitAssessmentWithWebSocket(assessmentData, assessmentName, onProgress);
}

// AFTER:
async submitAssessmentWithWebSocket(assessmentData, assessmentName = 'AI-Driven Talent Mapping', onProgress, onTokenBalanceUpdate) {
  console.log('ApiService: Using fixed WebSocket submission (direct call to prevent double token consumption)');
  const { submitAssessmentWithWebSocket } = await import('./enhanced-assessment-api');
  return await submitAssessmentWithWebSocket(assessmentData, assessmentName, onProgress, onTokenBalanceUpdate);
}
```

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### 1. **Manual Testing**
1. Complete an assessment in the form
2. Monitor browser console logs
3. Verify only ONE "THIS CONSUMES 1 TOKEN" message appears
4. Check token balance decreases by exactly 1

### 2. **Console Log Verification**
Look for these key messages in sequence:
```
‚úÖ Enhanced Assessment API: Submitting assessment with WebSocket monitoring - FIXED: Direct submission to prevent double token consumption
‚úÖ Enhanced Assessment API: submitAssessment called - THIS CONSUMES 1 TOKEN
‚úÖ Enhanced Assessment API: Assessment submitted with jobId: xxx - monitoring via WebSocket
```

### 3. **Token Balance Verification**
1. Check token balance before assessment
2. Complete and submit assessment
3. Verify token balance decreased by exactly 1

## üîÑ Comparison with Previous Fixes

This fix (V3) addresses a different issue than the previous fixes:
- **Fix V1:** Addressed double submission between direct path and loading page
- **Fix V2:** Added explicit return statements to prevent execution flow continuing
- **Fix V3 (current):** Removes redundant wrapper functions that caused double API calls

All three fixes work together to ensure only one token is consumed per assessment.
