# Persona Title Consistency Fix

## Problem Description

The user reported an inconsistency between the name column in the assessment history table and the title displayed in the personality profile cards. Specifically:

- **Assessment History Table**: Shows names from the `nama` field in assessment data
- **Personality Profile Cards**: Shows titles from `profile.title` in the persona profile
- **Issue**: These two sources were not always showing the same persona title

## Root Cause Analysis

The inconsistency was caused by a mismatch in the data mapping within the `fetchAssessmentHistoryFromAPI` function in `services/user-stats.ts`:

1. **API Response Mapping**: The function was using `result.persona_profile?.archetype` as the primary source for the assessment name
2. **Profile Cards**: The cards were correctly using `profile.title` from the persona profile
3. **Data Structure**: The actual persona profile structure uses `title` field, not `archetype`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed API Response Mapping

**File**: `services/user-stats.ts` (lines 226-247)

**Before**:
```typescript
nama: result.persona_profile?.archetype || result.assessment_name || 'Assessment Result'
```

**After**:
```typescript
nama: result.persona_profile?.title || result.persona_profile?.archetype || result.assessment_name || 'Assessment Result'
```

**Changes**:
- Added `result.persona_profile?.title` as the primary source
- Kept `archetype` as fallback for backward compatibility
- Added logging to track which source is being used

### 2. Enhanced Logging

Added debug logging to track persona title consistency:

```typescript
// Log for debugging persona title consistency
if (result.persona_profile) {
  console.log(`Archive API: Assessment ${result.id} - Using persona title: "${personaTitle}" (from ${result.persona_profile?.title ? 'title' : result.persona_profile?.archetype ? 'archetype' : 'fallback'})`);
}
```

Also enhanced localStorage fallback logging:

```typescript
console.log(`LocalStorage: Assessment ${item.resultId} - Updated nama from "${item.nama}" to "${assessmentResult.persona_profile.title}"`);
```

### 3. Created Test Page

**File**: `app/test-persona-title-consistency/page.tsx`

Created a comprehensive test page that:
- Displays both assessment history table and personality profile cards
- Performs automatic consistency checking
- Shows detailed debug information
- Provides refresh functionality to re-test after changes

## Data Flow Verification

### 1. Persona Profile Generation
- **Source**: `services/ai-analysis.ts` - `generateLocalAnalysis()` function
- **Field**: Returns `title` field in PersonaProfile interface
- **Example**: "The Creative Investigator", "The Dynamic Achiever"

### 2. Assessment History Population
- **API Route**: Uses `fetchAssessmentHistoryFromAPI()` → now correctly maps `persona_profile.title`
- **LocalStorage Route**: Uses `formatAssessmentHistory()` → already correctly used `persona_profile.title`

### 3. Profile Card Display
- **Source**: `components/results/PersonaProfileCard.tsx`
- **Field**: Uses `{profile.title}` - this was already correct

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Navigate to `/test-persona-title-consistency`
2. Check the consistency status indicator
3. Compare names in assessment history table with titles in profile cards
4. Review debug logs in browser console

### Expected Results
- ✅ Consistency check should show "All persona titles are consistent!"
- ✅ Assessment history table names should match profile card titles
- ✅ Console logs should show "Using persona title: ... (from title)"

## Backward Compatibility

The fix maintains backward compatibility by:
1. Keeping `archetype` as a fallback option
2. Preserving existing localStorage update logic
3. Not breaking any existing API contracts

## Related Files Modified

1. **services/user-stats.ts** - Fixed API response mapping and added logging
2. **app/test-persona-title-consistency/page.tsx** - New test page (created)
3. **docs/PERSONA_TITLE_CONSISTENCY_FIX.md** - This documentation (created)

## Verification

After implementing this fix:
1. The assessment history table should display the same persona titles as the personality profile cards
2. Both components should use the `title` field from the persona profile
3. The consistency should be maintained across API and localStorage data sources

## Future Considerations

1. **API Contract**: Ensure the backend API consistently returns `persona_profile.title`
2. **Data Migration**: Consider migrating any existing data that might still use `archetype` field
3. **Monitoring**: The added logging can help identify any remaining inconsistencies in production
